###### BUILD DEPENDENCYâ€™S 

the following packages are needed to build GxDistortionPlus:

- libc6-dev
- libgtk2.0-dev
- libstdc++6-dev
- lv2-dev

note that those packages could have different, but similar names 
on different distributions. There is no configure script, 
make will simply fail when one of those packages isn't found.
